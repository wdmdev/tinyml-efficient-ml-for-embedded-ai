# TinyML: Efficient Machine Learning for Embedded AI Systems

My way of creating an overview of a special course I am taking at [The Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/) as 
part of my MSc in Mathematical Modeling and Computation with a Machine Learning and Signal Processing specialization.

## Course Description

## Learning Objectives

A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:

* Program using the Rust language and the WGPU API.
* Describe how computational graphs work.
* Describe how virtualized memory hierarchies work.
* Describe how a GPU works and how it fits in the memory hierarchy.
* Describe basic concepts in smart pointers, graph representations and garbage collectors.
* Give an overview of core concepts in concurrency.
* Explain input events and event-based processing.
* Explain integers and bitwise operations as well as floats and precision.
* Perform performance profiling and optimization of complex heterogeneous systems.
* Analyze cases relevant to the students' specialization.
* Choose the right tools presented in the course for implementing their own project.
* Programming, presenting and analyzing the students' own real-time system.

## Evaluation
* Summary report of the learnings throughout the course

### Course work
The course will consist of:
* Lectures
* Some readings (mainly papers)
* Hands-on labs

## Schedule
The course starts on Friday 7 June and runs until Friday 28 June.
